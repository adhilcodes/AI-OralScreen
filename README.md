# AI-OralScreen(Screening of Oral Malignant Disorders)


## Architecture:
The original image size from the EfficientNet paper for EfficientNetB5 is 456x456x3. We are however not bound by this and can use a smaller size if we want. The original image sizes used for every version of EfficientNet are:

- EfficientNetB0 - (224, 224, 3)
- EfficientNetB1 - (240, 240, 3)
- EfficientNetB2 - (260, 260, 3)
- EfficientNetB3 - (300, 300, 3)
- EfficientNetB4 - (380, 380, 3)
- EfficientNetB5 - (456, 456, 3)
- EfficientNetB6 - (528, 528, 3)
- EfficientNetB7 - (600, 600, 3)
